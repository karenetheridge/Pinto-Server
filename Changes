    Now requires Pinto 0.23, which has a different interface.

0.019     2011-08-30 01:14:43 America/Los_Angeles

    Now requires Pinto 0.021, which behaves better in a 
    server environment.  I thought I had fixed this in version 
    0.017, but I was wrong.

    Now required Pinto 0.020, which supports the Nop action.

    pinto-server will now always pull/update your repository
    from VCS upon startup.  This helps ensure that the
    repository is in a good state when we start.  But we
    never pull/update again after that.

0.017     2011-08-24 00:24:17 America/Los_Angeles

    Now requires Pinto 0.017 or newer, which runs better under
    a server environment.

    All the guts of Pinto::Server are now in pinto-server, as
    this seemed to be the only way to integrate my Dancer
    routes with my own command-line switches without having
    to use Dancer's own configuration API.  I'm quite sure
    that I'm not using Dancer the way it is intended.

    Initial release.
