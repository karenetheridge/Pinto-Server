    Now requires Pinto 0.017 or newer, which runs better under
    a server environment.

    All the guts of Pinto::Server are now in pinto-server, as
    this seemed to be the only way to integrate my Dancer
    routes with my own command-line switches without having
    to use Dancer's own configuration API.  I'm quite sure
    that I'm not using Dancer the way it is intended.

    Initial release.
